# discogs-loader
If you want to access the discogs-api, you do not need Python, C or other languages. Here you can find some bash-scripts which I made to down-, upload some data only in bash.

All you need is *curl* normally it is installed on your system and *jq* if you use a ubuntu-like system you can install it with:
```
sudo apt-get install jq
```

### jq
... is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. All the data you get by the discogs-api is formated in JSON. 
After installing you can make a test-request with:
```
curl https://api.discogs.com/releases/12345 --user-agent "FooBarApp/3.0" | jq '.'
```
Now you can see the formated output of this JSON-data in your terminal window.
```
curl https://api.discogs.com/releases/123 --user-agent "FooBarApp/3.0" | jq -r '.tracklist[].title'
```
You can get some data-fields from JSON-Object. In this case all the tracks from the release 123.

Pasring the JSON-data is, how you can see, verry simple. Have a look to the bash-scripts here.

### discogs-token
If you are a registered discogs-user, you can create a token to get more information. For example you will get with *discogs_getreldata* all the picture-url's too. 

To create your token, go to the discogs-homepage and log in. Navigate to settings... devellopers... generate token... thats it. Vistit *https://www.discogs.com/developers/* for further description of the discogs-api and *https://stedolan.github.io/jq/* to learn about the usage of jq.

If you have your token and username create path/file in your home-folder:
```
$HOME/.config/discogs-loader/discogs.conf"
```
In this textfile insert your name, token in this form:
```
USER discogsmember007
TOKEN AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
```


# discogs_getreldata <- a little helper
Loads all the data from a release and prints to stdout.
- usage: discogs_getreldata release-no

# discogs_getrndpic
You need "convert" from "imagemagick"
```
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```
Download a random cover image from items in your collection or wantlist.
- usage: discogs_getrndpic "folder-name" "local-file-path/name.type" "picture-size"
  - folder-name:
    - "All" to get an image from any item in your collection
    - "Uncategorized" to get an image from items in folder "Uncategorized" in your collection
    - "Wantlist" to get an image from your wantlist items
    - "folder-name" to get an image from items in folder called "folder-name" in your collection
  - local-file-path/name.type (existing file will be overwritten)
    - "./mypic.png" download picture in format .png to working folder
    - "/home/username/picture.jpg" download in format .jpg to your home folder
    - "/tmp/picture.gif" save in tmp-folder as gif-file
  - picture-size: for example "600"
    - if discogs-picture is "500x500", local pic = 600x600
    - if discogs-picture is "400x500", local pic = 480x600
    - if discogs-picture is "500x400", local pic = 600x480

# discogs_flactagger
You can tag your flac files in terminal and download an image from discogs.
- usage: navigate to a folder with flac files and start *discogs_flactagger*
If you want to use this, please install (if not):
```
sudo apt-get install imagemagick flac 
```
Flac files in folder must be named cronological: "01.flac" "02.flac" "03.flac" or something like this. You must know your release number from discogs.

I have several versions from one release such as "Metallica - Kill 'em all" from vinyl, cd, cd repress from 2017. So my method to tag flac files is:
```
ARTIST      Metallica
ALBUM       Kill 'Em All [2003 Vinyl Album]
DATE        1983
GENRE       Thrash
GENRE       Speed Metal
TITLE       Hit The Lights
TRACKNUMBER 1
```
2003 in ALBUM means the release year from THIS release, 1983 in DATE means 1983 was the master release year... first time. In Album I have two other fields in [] Vinyl and Album, where this can be: Vinyl, CD, MC, Misc ; Album, Single, EP, Compilation, Misc.

With this method I can order my music database in kodi by year and have an ordered discography but can chose one of my different versions.

# discogs_exportcollection
Just start it without any parameters and you can download your own collection data, custom-fields, folder-infos, user-infos or any other user-collection, wantlist if it is public. Data will be exported in json-formated text and stored in a tar.gz file in your home folder.


# discogs_importcollection
If you have downloaded your or any other collection with discogs_exportcollection, now you need this script to upload local data to your discogs-account. You can upload:
- local wantlist to discogs wantlist
- local wantlist to any discogs collection folder
- local collection folder to any collection folder on discogs
- local collection folder to discogs wantlist
- the content of any local textfield to any discogs textfield
- the content of any local dropdown item to any discogs dropdown item

Let's have a look at the console output, so you can understand what is possible:
```
------------------------ DISCOGS IMPORT ------------------------
Enter user-name and user-token from discogs-account for upload.
Enter full path/filename of your local discogs-export-file.
user-name: XXXXXXXXX
user-token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
input-file full path/name: ./thomas

### Slow down-, upload
Data transfer will be limited by discogs, so the down-, upload need some time if the collection is large.
